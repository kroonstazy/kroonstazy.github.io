    <p>Graduated Califonia State University, Northridge in 2019.<br>
        During my senior year, I found great interest in "Decision Support System" course. <br>
        In that course, We did made a simple forcast/prediction model of Titanic Survivors.<br>
        It was the first time exposed to code in R. Withouth any backgrounds in programming, it was very diffcult at
        first time.<br>
        But, I saw a potential of Data Analysis in business world and took Data Analyst Bootcamp. <br>
        It was 9 months long course, there I learned <strong>python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost,
            tensorflow</strong>. <br>
